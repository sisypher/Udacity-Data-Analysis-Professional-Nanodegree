## Project 1 - Explore US Bikeshare Data

In this project, we make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

**To complete this project, the following software requirements apply:**

- You should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
- A text editor.
- A terminal application.

We learned about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, we wrote code to provide the following information:

### #1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day

### #2 Popular stations and trip

- most common start station
- most common end station
- most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

### #3 Trip duration

- total travel time
- average travel time

### #4 User info

- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### The Files

To answer these questions using Python, you need to write a Python script and the three city dataset files too:

- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

## Project 2 - Investigate a Dataset

In this project, we analyze a dataset and then communicate our findings about it. we use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make our analysis easier.

The analysis was conducted on the [No-show appointments Dataset](/Project%202%20-%20Investigate%20a%20Dataset/Database_No_show_appointments/noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016.csv) (original source on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments))

**To complete this project, the following software requirements apply:**

- Python
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- csv
